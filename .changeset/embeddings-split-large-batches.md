`openAiEmbeddings`: a batch the server refuses as too large — HTTP 413, or TEI's `batch size 64 > maximum allowed batch size 32` (its `--max-client-batch-size` defaults to 32 while `batchSize` defaults to 64) — is split in halves and retried instead of failing the whole ingestion, and later requests to the same server and model start at the size that worked (remembered for the process). Each split is reported through the new `onWarn` option. New export: `isBatchTooLarge(error)`.

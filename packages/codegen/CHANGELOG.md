## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ad8e446: Behavior-preserving simplification pass across the governance surfaces.

  - **core**: extract the shared, pure governance aggregation helpers
    (`estimateCost`, `bucketByModel`, `bucketByActor`, `bucketByThread`,
    `bucketUsageTrend`, `dayBoundsUtc`) so the cost formula, bucketing, and
    day-bounds math live in one place.
  - **store-mikro-orm / store-drizzle / testing**: the three
    `AgentGovernanceQueries` adapters now only fetch their DB-specific rows,
    map them to the shared `GovernanceUsageInput` shape, and call the core
    helpers — deleting the duplicated cost/bucket/day-bounds code.
  - **codegen**: fix the `USAGE`/`StoredMessage` wire contracts that had
    drifted from core's real types, and inject the four missing controller
    routes (agents catalog, thread rename/promote/truncate-from-message).
  - **telescope**: collapse the eight governance data providers into a single
    `governanceStatProvider(name, fetch, format)` factory.

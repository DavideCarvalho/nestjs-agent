 * How an imported MCP tool gets its {@link ToolKind}.
 *
 * The stakes: this library auto-executes a `read` tool and pauses the turn for human approval on an
 * `action` one. A tool imported from an MCP server was written by someone outside this codebase and
 * its effects are not visible from here, so the DEFAULT (`'action'`) is the conservative one — a
 * remote tool needs a human before it runs. Widening that is a decision the host makes explicitly:
 *
 *  - `'action'` (default) — every imported tool is HITL-gated.
 *  - `'read'` — every imported tool auto-executes. Only for a server you own and audit.
 *  - `'trust-annotations'` — believe the server's `readOnlyHint`. The hint is asserted by the very
 *    party whose effects it describes, so this is a statement of trust in that server, not a check.
 *  - a predicate — decide per tool (e.g. read for a known-safe name list, action for the rest).

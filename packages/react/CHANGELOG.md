### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/pull/3) [`abb32bc`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/abb32bc0396c65a59ee2b92a1a8b07d772215e31) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Ports the `StoredMessage → UIMessage` adapter consumers were hand-writing into the package as
  `storedMessageToUiMessage()`: text/attachment/tool parts, pairing a tool call with its result by id
  (falling back to `input-available` when a call never finished), and carrying the store's `toolKind`
  through as `toolMetadata` so a UI can gate approval affordances on `kind === 'action'` without
  hardcoding tool names.

  `AgentChatTransport` now forwards `toolKind` from `tool-input-start`/`tool-input-available` stream
  frames onto the emitted chunks' `toolMetadata`, and surfaces a step's `costUsd` (from `step-finish`)
  as a `message-metadata` chunk merged onto `message.metadata`. Both are additive and backend-version
  tolerant — an older backend that omits the fields never crashes the client.

  `useAgentChat` gains a `resume` option: when `true`, the hook fetches the thread on (re)mount and,
  if it carries a live `activeRunId`, automatically attaches to that run's stream — no more manually
  plumbing `resumeRunId` from a separate thread fetch. The resolved `activeRunId` is exposed on the
  hook's return value. `AgentClient` gains `updateThread(id, { title?, defaultAgent? })` (general
  `PATCH /agent/threads/:id`, which `renameThread` now delegates to) and `uploadAttachment(file)`
  (multipart `POST /agent/attachments`, returning a `MessageAttachment` ready to ride a send's
  `attachments`).

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`d1679b0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d1679b01f65b09ab35ac2cbb304d1f21c0a1ad46) - Carry image/PDF attachments through a chat turn so a vision-capable model sees them natively. A new
  `MessageAttachment` (`{ mediaId, url, contentType, name }`) rides an optional `attachments` field on
  `AgentRunInput`, `AppendMessageInput`, `StoredMessage`, and `ModelMessage`: the chat controller and
  `AgentService` accept it, the loop persists it on the user message and replays it, the MikroORM store
  round-trips it as a JSON column on `agent_message` (auto-added by the additive schema heal — no
  migration), and the AI-SDK adapter renders a user message with attachments as native `image`/`file`
  content parts (`image/*` → image, else file — Bedrock Claude reads a PDF this way). The React
  transport forwards per-send attachments via the request body
  (`sendMessage({ text }, { body: { attachments } })`).

  All fields are optional, so text-only consumers are unaffected. The lib stays provider-agnostic: it
  passes the attachment `url` straight through as the part's source — making that URL reachable by the
  provider (presigned S3, a proxy) is the consumer's concern; the lib never fetches bytes or talks to a
  store.

- [`d1679b0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d1679b01f65b09ab35ac2cbb304d1f21c0a1ad46) - Stream structured turn events so clients render text, reasoning, and live tool-call cards — not just
  text. The sink now carries an NDJSON `AgentStreamEvent` vocabulary (`step-start`/`step-finish`,
  `text`, `reasoning`, `tool-input-start`/`-delta`/`-available`, `tool-output`/`-error`): the AI-SDK
  adapter emits model parts, the loop emits tool results, the chat controller forwards each line as an
  SSE frame, and the React transport maps them back to the AI SDK UI-message chunk protocol. Tool
  cards (input streaming → rendered output) and reasoning now appear live via `useAgentChat`, matching
  a native `streamText().toUIMessageStream()` while keeping the sink a format-agnostic byte buffer
  (durable buffering/replay untouched).

  Note: this changes the on-the-wire chat SSE protocol from `{delta}` text frames to
  `AgentStreamEvent` frames — upgrade backend (`@dudousxd/nestjs-agent`) and client
  (`@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-react`) together.

- [`d1679b0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d1679b01f65b09ab35ac2cbb304d1f21c0a1ad46) - Fix a threadless chat spawning a new thread on every message. `useAgentChat` captured the
  backend-created thread id from the `meta` frame only into `runId` — so the next send still carried
  no `threadId` and the backend minted another thread. It now remembers the created id and reuses it
  on subsequent sends, and exposes an `onThreadCreated(threadId)` callback so the consumer can sync its
  URL/router to the newly created thread (title, sidebar, and reload then bind to it).

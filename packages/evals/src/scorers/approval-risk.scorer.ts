 * How likely a human is to reject what this run proposed — BEFORE a human looks at it.
 *
 * {@link import('./approval-outcome.scorer.js').ApprovalOutcomeScorer} reads verdicts that already
 * exist; this turns the same corpus into a prediction, so a pending approvals inbox can be drained
 * riskiest-first and a run that is about to be rejected can be caught while it is still cheap. It
 * is the statistical family, not the rule-based one: the number is a smoothed frequency estimate
 * over past decisions, and its `metadata` carries the sample it rests on so a 1-of-1 rejection is
 * never mistaken for certainty.
 *
 * A run scores as its WORST proposed action, not the average of them. A turn that proposes one tool
 * humans reject nine times in ten is a risky turn no matter how many safe reads it made alongside.
 *
 * `null` for a run that proposed no action — the same "not applicable, not perfect" rule as the
 * outcome scorer.

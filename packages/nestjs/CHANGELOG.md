# @dudousxd/nestjs-agent

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`781a30f`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/781a30f6579d5b9a69f341b8eeac02c273dbb8a1) - `dispatchedSteps` now defaults to ON under `durable: true` (opt out with `dispatchedSteps: false`).
  The cross-process-sink requirement was never specific to dispatched steps — under `durable: true`
  the turn already runs on whichever worker takes `agent.run`, which may not hold the SSE connection
  — and the `AgentRunSteps` worker groups are always registered, so the routed steps are never
  unserved. Dispatching the model call and tool executions is the correct production posture: the
  run leaves its pod during the two long steps and the llm step gets engine retry.

  Upgrade note: a run in flight across a deploy that changes the effective mode replays with
  different step kinds and fails that one turn (send the message again). Multi-pod fleets should
  already be on a cross-process sink (e.g. `RedisTokenStreamSink`) for durable streaming; the boot
  warning now names `dispatchedSteps: false` as the alternative.

- [`eb3aaff`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/eb3aaff531cc923de1d0bccebb2b0690b4c92263) - Governance wave — approvals inbox, tool stats, prompt hash:

  - **HITL approvals inbox**: new `AGENT_APPROVAL_PORT` SPI (`AgentApprovalPort`) bound by the agent
    runtime — console-side approve/reject routed through the SAME decision path chat approvals use
    (durable signal or inline resolution), WITHOUT re-authorization (the console's own guards front
    it). `Decision` gained optional `executedByRef`; the loop persists the decider on both executed
    and rejected action tools (`decision.executedByRef ?? the run's actor`). Governance read
    `pendingApprovals(limit)` (oldest first, joined to thread/actor). Dashboard: Approvals section
    (pending list, approve/reject with reason, nav badge) + `GET approvals` / `POST
approvals/:toolCallId`; new `approvalActorRef` dashboard option stamps WHO decided from the live
    request; the API returns 501 (and the SPA renders read-only) when no port is bound.
  - **Tool governance**: `toolStats(range)` — per-tool calls/failed/rejected + p95 executionMs —
    and a dashboard Tools section.
  - **Prompt hash**: each run records the sha256 of its resolved system prompt (pre-RAG, so it
    identifies the prompt VERSION), surfaced on recent runs in the dashboard — correlate error-rate
    shifts with prompt changes.

### Minor Changes

- [`1c44152`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/1c4415295a6280527e762f13e6aed48099ae5ca5) - Dispatched turn steps — opt-in `dispatchedSteps: true` (requires `durable: true`) dispatches the
  turn's two LONG steps as routed durable steps instead of in-process localSteps, so a run is no
  longer pinned to its pod while the model call or a tool executes:

  - `AgentRunSteps.llm` (`@Step({ retries: 3 })`): resolves the model/sink/tool definitions from the
    serving worker's own DI and streams from wherever it runs. `AgentRunSteps.tool` (no retries —
    tool idempotency is the app's domain): rebuilds the tool ctx and applies the tool timeout
    handler-side. Both are ALWAYS registered by `AgentDurableModule` (worker groups always served);
    the flag only controls dispatching. Bookkeeping steps (persist/quota/stream markers) stay local —
    dispatching a 10ms DB write through a queue buys nothing.
  - Core: serializable `LlmStepEnvelope`/`ToolStepEnvelope` (`ToolStepCtx` excludes `host`, re-attached
    from DI handler-side; the llm envelope carries the `actor` and the handler re-derives tool
    definitions — live schema instances never cross the wire), optional `dispatchLlm`/`dispatchTool`
    loop hooks (absent = behavior identical to before), exported `withToolTimeout`.
  - Core: new `AgentLoopHooks.isControlFlowError` — the durable runner's suspend/continue-as-new
    signals now escape the loop's tool catch instead of being mispersisted as tool failures (which
    diverged on replay).
  - Multi-pod fleets MUST wire a cross-process token sink (e.g. `RedisTokenStreamSink`); a boot
    warning fires when `dispatchedSteps` is on with the default in-process sink.

- [`1c44152`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/1c4415295a6280527e762f13e6aed48099ae5ca5) - Run reliability metrics — run outcomes are now durably recorded and surfaced as governance reads
  and a dashboard Reliability section:

  - Store SPI: optional `recordRunStart`/`recordRunEnd`/`bumpRunRetries` on `AgentStore` (absent =
    graceful no-op). The loop records start/completed (with duration) as checkpointed steps; the
    runners (durable workflow + inline) record failures with error code/message. Both bundled store
    adapters ship the new `agent_run` table (autoSchema-managed, in the managed-tables lists).
  - `AgentGovernanceQueries` grew `runMetrics`, `runsByAgent`, `runErrors`, `runTrend`, `recentRuns`
    (REQUIRED members — external adapters must implement them; return zeros/empty when the backing
    store never records runs). In-memory testing impls included.
  - Dashboard: `GET <api>/reliability?from&to` + `GET <api>/runs?limit`, and a Reliability section in
    the SPA — success/error rate, retries, p95 duration, run/failure trend, failure breakdown by
    error code, recent runs table.
  - `DispatchedLlmInput` carries `runId` so llm-step retries can be attributed to the run; the retry
    counter stays 0 until the durable runtime exposes the attempt number to remote step handlers.

### Patch Changes

- [`66e9ad8`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/66e9ad80347c6e1488041e643a1e8d881410de6f) - Fix `durable: true` under nestjs-durable >= 0.31 (core >= 0.50): `AgentRunWorkflow` now checkpoints
  the turn's steps with `ctx.localStep` instead of `ctx.step`. Since durable's single-step collapse,
  `ctx.step(name, input)` is ALWAYS dispatched — the name becomes a routing worker-group and the
  closure was silently serialized away as "input", so every agent step landed on a queue no worker
  serves (`persist-user@<tenant>`, `deactivate@<tenant>`) and the run suspended forever. The agent
  loop's steps are closures over in-process turn state (model provider, open SSE sink) with dynamic
  checkpoint-identity names, which is exactly what `localStep` is for — same durability (checkpointed
  outputs, replay skips completed steps, HITL suspend/resume), no dispatch.

  Durable peer floors raised to match: `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable >= 0.34.0`,
  `@dudousxd/nestjs-durable-core >= 0.51.0` (the versions that expose `localStep` on `WorkflowCtx`).

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/pull/3) [`abb32bc`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/abb32bc0396c65a59ee2b92a1a8b07d772215e31) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - `AgentModule.forRoot()`/`forRootAsync()` gain a `guards` option (`Type<CanActivate>[]`), stamped
  uniformly on every mounted controller (chat, threads, tool-call, quota, agents, and attachments) via
  `@nestjs/common`'s own `@UseGuards` metadata key with REPLACE semantics — a repeated module
  registration never accumulates guards onto the shared controller classes. Guard classes are added to
  the module's `providers` for DI.

  Tool-related `AgentStreamEvent` frames (`tool-input-start`, `tool-input-available`) now carry an
  additive `toolKind: 'read' | 'action'` (collapsing the `agent` delegation kind into `read`, since
  that's the distinction a client actually needs — approval-gated or not), stamped from the tool
  registry so a UI no longer has to hardcode a tool-name allowlist to know which calls need approval.
  Persisted tool calls (`StoredMessage.toolCalls[].kind`) carry the full `ToolKind` (`read | action |
agent`) for the same reason on the thread-read side.

  Per-step/message token usage now prices into `costUsd: number | null` — on the `step-finish` stream
  frame and the persisted assistant message's `usage` — via the optionally-bound `AGENT_PRICING_STORE`
  (a provider-reported cost wins when the model turn reports one). The price list is fetched once per
  run and reused for every step, not re-fetched per message. `null` (never a fabricated `0`) when no
  pricing store is bound or the model has no price row.

  `AgentStore` gains two OPTIONAL SPI methods so existing stores keep compiling: `updateThread(threadId,
{ title?, defaultAgent? })` and `activeRunForThread(threadId)`. Thread read/list payloads add
  `defaultAgent: string | null` and `activeRunId: string | null` (`null` when the bound store doesn't
  implement the corresponding method). `PATCH /agent/threads/:id` now accepts `{ title?, defaultAgent?
}` (title-only patches still work against any store via the required `setTitle`; a `defaultAgent`
  change 501s with a clear message against a store that lacks `updateThread`). `chat()` without an
  explicit `agentName` on a thread whose `defaultAgent` is set now uses it — explicit `agentName` still
  wins, the module's configured default is the final fallback. `@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-testing`'s
  `InMemoryAgentStore` implements both new methods (the latter by reading the same `activeStreamId`
  field `setActiveStream` already maintains, now correctly cleared to `null` when a run finishes or
  fails instead of staying stamped forever).

  New core SPIs, both optional and unbound by default: `ActorDirectory` (`AGENT_ACTOR_DIRECTORY`) —
  resolves opaque store `actorRef`s to display labels for governance/dashboard read surfaces — and
  `AttachmentStagingStore` (`AGENT_ATTACHMENT_STAGING`) — persists an uploaded file and returns the
  `MessageAttachment` to send with the next chat message. When the latter is bound and
  `AgentModuleOptions.attachments.upload` is `true` (a static flag — controllers are build-time; DI is
  run-time), `POST /agent/attachments` mounts (multipart, single `file` field, buffered in memory,
  validated against a configurable size cap / content-type allowlist) under the same path prefix and
  guards as the other controllers. `upload: true` with nothing bound to `AGENT_ATTACHMENT_STAGING` fails
  boot loudly instead of mounting a controller that would 501 on every request.

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- [`d1679b0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d1679b01f65b09ab35ac2cbb304d1f21c0a1ad46) - Carry image/PDF attachments through a chat turn so a vision-capable model sees them natively. A new
  `MessageAttachment` (`{ mediaId, url, contentType, name }`) rides an optional `attachments` field on
  `AgentRunInput`, `AppendMessageInput`, `StoredMessage`, and `ModelMessage`: the chat controller and
  `AgentService` accept it, the loop persists it on the user message and replays it, the MikroORM store
  round-trips it as a JSON column on `agent_message` (auto-added by the additive schema heal — no
  migration), and the AI-SDK adapter renders a user message with attachments as native `image`/`file`
  content parts (`image/*` → image, else file — Bedrock Claude reads a PDF this way). The React
  transport forwards per-send attachments via the request body
  (`sendMessage({ text }, { body: { attachments } })`).

  All fields are optional, so text-only consumers are unaffected. The lib stays provider-agnostic: it
  passes the attachment `url` straight through as the part's source — making that URL reachable by the
  provider (presigned S3, a proxy) is the consumer's concern; the lib never fetches bytes or talks to a
  store.

- [`d1679b0`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d1679b01f65b09ab35ac2cbb304d1f21c0a1ad46) - Stream structured turn events so clients render text, reasoning, and live tool-call cards — not just
  text. The sink now carries an NDJSON `AgentStreamEvent` vocabulary (`step-start`/`step-finish`,
  `text`, `reasoning`, `tool-input-start`/`-delta`/`-available`, `tool-output`/`-error`): the AI-SDK
  adapter emits model parts, the loop emits tool results, the chat controller forwards each line as an
  SSE frame, and the React transport maps them back to the AI SDK UI-message chunk protocol. Tool
  cards (input streaming → rendered output) and reasoning now appear live via `useAgentChat`, matching
  a native `streamText().toUIMessageStream()` while keeping the sink a format-agnostic byte buffer
  (durable buffering/replay untouched).

  Note: this changes the on-the-wire chat SSE protocol from `{delta}` text frames to
  `AgentStreamEvent` frames — upgrade backend (`@dudousxd/nestjs-agent`) and client
  (`@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-react`) together.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Add a `GET <agentPath>/agents` catalog endpoint that lists the discovered
  `@Agent` classes (`{ name, description, isDefault? }`) from the `AgentRegistry`,
  so a frontend picker can source personas from the backend instead of hardcoding
  them. `@Agent({ description })` is now also carried through discovery onto the
  `AgentDefinition` (it was previously declared but dropped). `ActorResolver` is
  made generic over the request type (`ActorResolver<TReq = unknown>`) so hosts
  can implement it against their concrete request without an `unknown`-narrowing
  guard; the default type parameter keeps every existing call site source-compatible.

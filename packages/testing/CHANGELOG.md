## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#56](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/pull/56) [`7c27376`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/7c273763eeb6d5841028612d81acc63b2a8dd4eb) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Page the approvals inbox, open a run or a thread, and report p50 next to p95

  The governance read-model could answer "what happened" but not "how much of it is there" or
  "what happened _here_". Three gaps, one shape of fix.

  **The approvals inbox was capped and silently truncating.** `pendingApprovals(limit)` returns a
  capped list with no total, so a backlog past the cap was invisible — nothing on screen said so.
  That is the worst failure a human-in-the-loop queue can have. `approvalsPage` gives it the same
  paged treatment `runsPage`/`threadsPage`/`toolCallsPage` already have, with a `total` and filters
  on `toolName`/`threadId`/`actorRef`/`agentName`/day bounds, exposed as `GET approvals-page`.
  Ordering is `createdAt asc, id asc` — the `id` makes it a total order, and ascending means a newly
  requested approval appends past the last page instead of shifting the page an operator is reading.
  `GET approvals` stays: the console's own SPA still calls it, and telescope's inbox table reads the
  SPI method directly. Telescope's pending-approvals STAT now reads `approvalsPage(...).total`, which
  replaces an explicitly-documented undercount (it counted a 500-row capped list).

  **Every table row was a dead end.** `runDetail(runId)` returns a run, its owning thread's headline
  and its tool calls; `threadDetail({ threadId, messageLimit, runLimit })` returns a thread, its
  lifetime token/cost rollup, its newest runs and its newest messages. One round trip each, and a
  fixed query count inside — per-message tool-call counts are one batched read, not one per message.
  Exposed as `GET runs/:runId` and `GET threads/:threadId`, 404 on an unknown id (a console that
  renders an empty detail instead sends an operator hunting a bug that isn't there). A soft-deleted
  thread is returned flagged `deleted: true` rather than 404'd — an audit needs the thread it just
  lost. Run detail carries no cost figure: the token ledger has no run column, so per-run spend is
  not attributable without a store migration, and inventing a number would be worse than omitting it.

  **`toolStats` reported only a tail.** It had p95 and no measure of the typical call, so a tool whose
  median is 100ms and whose p95 is 10s looked the same as one that is uniformly slow. Added
  `p50ExecutionMs` alongside. Not a mean: latency is long-tailed, and an average of nine 100ms calls
  and one 10s call is ~1s — a number no call in the sample ever produced. Percentiles stay in-process
  off the sorted sample, as they already were, because MySQL has no `PERCENTILE_CONT` and one portable
  implementation beats three dialect-specific ones.

  Also in this change:

  - `where[threadId]` on `GET runs-page` now works. Every adapter's `RunWhere` already supported it;
    only the query parser rejected it, so "show me this thread's runs" 400'd with "Unknown where
    field" — exactly the follow-up query a drill-down leads to.
  - `recentThreads`/`threadsPage` no longer issue two queries per row. Both SQL adapters batch the
    message counts and token totals across the whole page, so a 200-row page costs two statements
    instead of four hundred round trips.
  - The typed client (`@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-dashboard/client`) gains `approvalsPage`, `runDetail`
    and `threadDetail`, and picks up `runId` on the tool-call and pending-approval rows — the server
    had been sending it and the mirror had drifted.

  `AgentGovernanceQueries` gains three required methods (`approvalsPage`, `runDetail`,
  `threadDetail`), matching how the paged reads were added. An out-of-tree adapter implementing the
  interface must add them; all three in-tree adapters (MikroORM, Drizzle, in-memory) do.

### Patch Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/pull/59) [`d115cb7`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/d115cb7973aafa539eafbb1e488259044a562069) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Stop a `core` minor from promoting half the monorepo to 1.0.0.

  Five packages declared their peer dependency on `@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-core` as `workspace:*`. Changesets treats a peer-dependency bump as breaking for the dependent, and "breaking" on a `0.x` package means `1.0.0` — so the moment `core` took a minor, `ai-sdk`, `rag`, `store-mikro-orm`, `testing` and `transport-redis` were all queued to publish as `1.0.0`. `rag-media` went with them by cascade: its own range on `core` was correct, but its `>=0.4.0 <1.0.0` on `rag` stopped being satisfied once `rag` majored.

  The ranges are now `>=0.10.0 <1.0.0`, matching what `dashboard` and `rag-media` already declared. `onlyUpdatePeerDependentsWhenOutOfRange` is already set in the changesets config, and with a range that a `0.11.0` core still satisfies it does its job. `dashboard` is the control: it peer-depends on `core` too, and it was the one package that did _not_ major, because its range was written this way from the start.

  Verified by running `changeset version` against the same set of changesets before and after: six `1.0.0` bumps become the minors and patches those changesets actually asked for.

  Consumers would have felt this as silence rather than breakage. A dependant on `^0.7.0` of `rag` does not match `1.0.0`, so it simply stops receiving updates, with nothing failing anywhere to say so.

- [`107fcc2`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/107fcc2c0079f97c3cc9ff8c83f2dc41070244d5) - Trace navigation + paged Agent tab + headless docs:

  - Tool calls carry their `runId` end to end (RecordToolCallInput → both stores' nullable run_id →
    ToolCallActivityRow/PendingApprovalRow), and `RunWhere.threadId` filters runs by thread — every
    activity row can now deep-link to its run's trace.
  - Telescope Agent tab: tool-call/run rows link to the TRACES waterfall (`#/traces/{runId}`,
    internal default); the three activity tables use the paged SPI reads with real pagination
    controls (`paged: true`, telescope >= 1.18, dep floor raised); the dashboard regrouped into six
    coherent sections with no orphan half-width panels.
  - react README documents "Bring your own UI" — the package is headless by design; the snippets
    compile against the current API.

  - Sections live on ROUTES now — hash routing (`/ai-gateway#/reliability`, `#/approvals`, …),
    deep-linkable on full page load, consistent with the durable console, zero new dependencies.
  - The list surfaces (tool calls, threads, runs) are paginated and filterable end to end:
    `AgentGovernanceQueries` grew `toolCallsPage`/`threadsPage`/`runsPage` (neutral
    `GovernancePageQuery` with typed `where` — REQUIRED members, implemented in both bundled stores
    with real COUNT + offset, deterministic id tiebreaks, case-insensitive title search, one-sided
    day bounds; in-memory testing impls included). The dashboard API speaks the ecosystem's familiar
    wire grammar (`page`, `limit`, `where[field]=value`, unknown field → 400) and the SPA tables get
    prev/next pagination with per-table debounced filters. The latest-N reads remain for the
    telescope bridge.

### Minor Changes

- [`eb3aaff`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/eb3aaff531cc923de1d0bccebb2b0690b4c92263) - Governance wave — approvals inbox, tool stats, prompt hash:

  - **HITL approvals inbox**: new `AGENT_APPROVAL_PORT` SPI (`AgentApprovalPort`) bound by the agent
    runtime — console-side approve/reject routed through the SAME decision path chat approvals use
    (durable signal or inline resolution), WITHOUT re-authorization (the console's own guards front
    it). `Decision` gained optional `executedByRef`; the loop persists the decider on both executed
    and rejected action tools (`decision.executedByRef ?? the run's actor`). Governance read
    `pendingApprovals(limit)` (oldest first, joined to thread/actor). Dashboard: Approvals section
    (pending list, approve/reject with reason, nav badge) + `GET approvals` / `POST
approvals/:toolCallId`; new `approvalActorRef` dashboard option stamps WHO decided from the live
    request; the API returns 501 (and the SPA renders read-only) when no port is bound.
  - **Tool governance**: `toolStats(range)` — per-tool calls/failed/rejected + p95 executionMs —
    and a dashboard Tools section.
  - **Prompt hash**: each run records the sha256 of its resolved system prompt (pre-RAG, so it
    identifies the prompt VERSION), surfaced on recent runs in the dashboard — correlate error-rate
    shifts with prompt changes.

### Minor Changes

- [`1c44152`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/1c4415295a6280527e762f13e6aed48099ae5ca5) - Run reliability metrics — run outcomes are now durably recorded and surfaced as governance reads
  and a dashboard Reliability section:

  - Store SPI: optional `recordRunStart`/`recordRunEnd`/`bumpRunRetries` on `AgentStore` (absent =
    graceful no-op). The loop records start/completed (with duration) as checkpointed steps; the
    runners (durable workflow + inline) record failures with error code/message. Both bundled store
    adapters ship the new `agent_run` table (autoSchema-managed, in the managed-tables lists).
  - `AgentGovernanceQueries` grew `runMetrics`, `runsByAgent`, `runErrors`, `runTrend`, `recentRuns`
    (REQUIRED members — external adapters must implement them; return zeros/empty when the backing
    store never records runs). In-memory testing impls included.
  - Dashboard: `GET <api>/reliability?from&to` + `GET <api>/runs?limit`, and a Reliability section in
    the SPA — success/error rate, retries, p95 duration, run/failure trend, failure breakdown by
    error code, recent runs table.
  - `DispatchedLlmInput` carries `runId` so llm-step retries can be attributed to the run; the retry
    counter stays 0 until the durable runtime exposes the attempt number to remote step handlers.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/pull/3) [`abb32bc`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/abb32bc0396c65a59ee2b92a1a8b07d772215e31) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - `AgentModule.forRoot()`/`forRootAsync()` gain a `guards` option (`Type<CanActivate>[]`), stamped
  uniformly on every mounted controller (chat, threads, tool-call, quota, agents, and attachments) via
  `@nestjs/common`'s own `@UseGuards` metadata key with REPLACE semantics — a repeated module
  registration never accumulates guards onto the shared controller classes. Guard classes are added to
  the module's `providers` for DI.

  Tool-related `AgentStreamEvent` frames (`tool-input-start`, `tool-input-available`) now carry an
  additive `toolKind: 'read' | 'action'` (collapsing the `agent` delegation kind into `read`, since
  that's the distinction a client actually needs — approval-gated or not), stamped from the tool
  registry so a UI no longer has to hardcode a tool-name allowlist to know which calls need approval.
  Persisted tool calls (`StoredMessage.toolCalls[].kind`) carry the full `ToolKind` (`read | action |
agent`) for the same reason on the thread-read side.

  Per-step/message token usage now prices into `costUsd: number | null` — on the `step-finish` stream
  frame and the persisted assistant message's `usage` — via the optionally-bound `AGENT_PRICING_STORE`
  (a provider-reported cost wins when the model turn reports one). The price list is fetched once per
  run and reused for every step, not re-fetched per message. `null` (never a fabricated `0`) when no
  pricing store is bound or the model has no price row.

  `AgentStore` gains two OPTIONAL SPI methods so existing stores keep compiling: `updateThread(threadId,
{ title?, defaultAgent? })` and `activeRunForThread(threadId)`. Thread read/list payloads add
  `defaultAgent: string | null` and `activeRunId: string | null` (`null` when the bound store doesn't
  implement the corresponding method). `PATCH /agent/threads/:id` now accepts `{ title?, defaultAgent?
}` (title-only patches still work against any store via the required `setTitle`; a `defaultAgent`
  change 501s with a clear message against a store that lacks `updateThread`). `chat()` without an
  explicit `agentName` on a thread whose `defaultAgent` is set now uses it — explicit `agentName` still
  wins, the module's configured default is the final fallback. `@dudousxd/nestjs-agent-testing`'s
  `InMemoryAgentStore` implements both new methods (the latter by reading the same `activeStreamId`
  field `setActiveStream` already maintains, now correctly cleared to `null` when a run finishes or
  fails instead of staying stamped forever).

  New core SPIs, both optional and unbound by default: `ActorDirectory` (`AGENT_ACTOR_DIRECTORY`) —
  resolves opaque store `actorRef`s to display labels for governance/dashboard read surfaces — and
  `AttachmentStagingStore` (`AGENT_ATTACHMENT_STAGING`) — persists an uploaded file and returns the
  `MessageAttachment` to send with the next chat message. When the latter is bound and
  `AgentModuleOptions.attachments.upload` is `true` (a static flag — controllers are build-time; DI is
  run-time), `POST /agent/attachments` mounts (multipart, single `file` field, buffered in memory,
  validated against a configurable size cap / content-type allowlist) under the same path prefix and
  guards as the other controllers. `upload: true` with nothing bound to `AGENT_ATTACHMENT_STAGING` fails
  boot loudly instead of mounting a controller that would 501 on every request.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- ad8e446: Behavior-preserving simplification pass across the governance surfaces.

  - **core**: extract the shared, pure governance aggregation helpers
    (`estimateCost`, `bucketByModel`, `bucketByActor`, `bucketByThread`,
    `bucketUsageTrend`, `dayBoundsUtc`) so the cost formula, bucketing, and
    day-bounds math live in one place.
  - **store-mikro-orm / store-drizzle / testing**: the three
    `AgentGovernanceQueries` adapters now only fetch their DB-specific rows,
    map them to the shared `GovernanceUsageInput` shape, and call the core
    helpers — deleting the duplicated cost/bucket/day-bounds code.
  - **codegen**: fix the `USAGE`/`StoredMessage` wire contracts that had
    drifted from core's real types, and inject the four missing controller
    routes (agents catalog, thread rename/promote/truncate-from-message).
  - **telescope**: collapse the eight governance data providers into a single
    `governanceStatProvider(name, fetch, format)` factory.

### Patch Changes

- [`60dcc7d`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/nestjs-agent/commit/60dcc7db3764a7d60cb6e4d586f1c0fe7b05ee04) - Governance queries: add `spendByThread(range, limit)` (top threads by cost) and
  `ActorSpendRow.threadCount`. Cost is now priced through the injected
  `AGENT_PRICING_STORE` instead of reading `agent_model_pricing` directly, and both
  store modules accept a `pricingStore` option so a host can bind its own pricing
  table as the single source of cost truth for every governance surface. Default
  behavior (the store's own pricing table) is unchanged.

  The dashboard (`/ai-gateway`) and the Telescope Agent tab gain a "Top threads by
  cost" panel fed by `spendByThread`.

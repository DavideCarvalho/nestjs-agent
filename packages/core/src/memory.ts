/**
 * Memory: what the assistant has concluded about a person or an organisation, carried across turns
 * and across threads.
 *
 * HOW A READER TELLS IT FROM RAG. Retrieval answers "what do the documents say"; memory answers
 * "what did I decide about you". A passage is content a person authored and can correct at its
 * source, and it is cited. A memory has no source to go and fix: it is the agent's own inference,
 * which is why every record carries an {@link MemoryOrigin} (who wrote it, in which conversation),
 * why the block tells the model to treat it as fallible, and why `forget` is a REQUIRED method on
 * the provider rather than an optional one. A wrong document is a content problem. A wrong memory is
 * the assistant being confidently wrong about someone with nobody aware it is there, so the whole
 * design is arranged around making it visible and removable.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS THE PROMPT. One line per memory, capped by `maxMemories`, and each line capped by
 * `maxFactChars` at WRITE time — so the block a turn can carry is the product of two numbers an
 * operator sets, rather than however much the model felt like writing down. Unlike a skill, a memory
 * has no body/catalog split: a fact that cannot be stated in a line is not a memory, it is a
 * document, and documents are retrieval's job.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: recall over a TRANSCRIPT. Searching what was said earlier is retrieval, and this
 * library already has `Retriever`/`Reranker` for that.
 *
 * RECALL OVER THE MEMORIES THEMSELVES IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION, and it is answered here. The prompt
 * budget must be bounded; the store has no reason to be. A person accumulates preferences over
 * months and an organisation publishes facts for everyone in it, so the applicable set outgrows
 * `maxMemories` quickly — and once it does, WHICH of them the block carries is a decision somebody
 * has to make. Making it by scope starves the widest scopes first, which is precisely backwards: the
 * facts that apply to the most people are the ones nobody sees. So a provider MAY supply
 * {@link MemoryProvider.search}, and where it does, the block is filled by relevance to the turn
 * (see {@link resolveMemoryDigest}) with scope still a hard filter and never a ranking signal.
 * `maxMemories` then means "how many matter right now" rather than "how many a person may have".

 *    from, with no document to inspect and nobody aware it was written. An agent that has genuinely
 *    learned something the organisation should know proposes it; a person publishes it.

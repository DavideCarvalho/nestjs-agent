 * The two seams that see a turn's traffic to and from the model: an {@link InputProcessor} rewrites

 * redact, replace or refuse it. Wire them as `AgentLoopDeps.inputProcessors` /
 * `outputProcessors`, or via `AgentModule.forRoot({ inputProcessors, outputProcessors })`.
 *
 * WHAT THESE ARE NOT: a second way to decide what enters the context. `HistoryPolicy` owns
 * SELECTION — which of the thread's messages ride into the turn, and what stands in for the rest.
 * Processors run on whatever selection produced and own TRANSFORMATION — what those messages say.
 * The distinction is load-bearing rather than stylistic: selection is contractually pure and is what
 * the `load:thread` checkpoint records, so it bounds the journal as well as the prompt, while a
 * processor is allowed to call a model, runs in a checkpoint of its own per step, and rewrites a
 * DERIVED prompt that never becomes the thread's own memory of what was said. Splitting the same
 * decision across both means neither can be reasoned about alone, and the cheap one stops being the
 * whole answer to "why did this turn cost that much".

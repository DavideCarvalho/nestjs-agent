 *                     and the person should see the error before more of their messages are spent.
 *  - `cancelled`      someone pressed Stop. Stop means stop: the queue does not start behind it.
 *                     An interrupt (`mode: 'interrupt'`) is the exception — its message starts.
 *  - `quota_exceeded` the next message's actor is over budget; resuming later retries the check.
 *  - `start_failed`   the next message could not be started (the runner refused it).

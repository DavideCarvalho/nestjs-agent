 * the sentence that mentions it — and a client that shipped its own name-to-sentence map would go
 * stale the moment a tool was renamed. A tool name is an identifier, never copy.
 *
 * `running` / `done` (and `confirm.title`, `confirm.detail`, `result.text`) are templates:
 * `{dotted.path}` placeholders are filled from the call's INPUT (or, for `result`, its OUTPUT), so one
 * declaration covers every call the tool will ever receive and replays identically from history.
 * A placeholder with nothing behind it collapses along with the space before it.
